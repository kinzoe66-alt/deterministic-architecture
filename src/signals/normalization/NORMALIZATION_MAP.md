# SIGNAL NORMALIZATION MAP

Purpose:
Map raw detections into normalized signals.

Example:
- Raw text mentions urgency → Time Pressure : present
- No explicit constraint → Irreversibility : not explicit

Rules:
- No scoring
- No weighting
- No optimization
- No aggregation

Normalization is a translation layer only.
