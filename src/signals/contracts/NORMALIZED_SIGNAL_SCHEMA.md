# NORMALIZED_SIGNAL_SCHEMA

Purpose:
Define the canonical shape of signals after normalization.

Rules:
- Signals are descriptive only
- Signals do not imply action
- Signals are stable across environments

Fields:
- signal_id
- signal_label
- signal_state (present / absent / indeterminate)
- confidence (low / medium / high)
- source_schema

Notes:
Normalization ensures consistency, not correctness.
