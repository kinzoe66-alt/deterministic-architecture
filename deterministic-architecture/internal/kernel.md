# OB-STAR KERNEL
Status: IMMUTABLE CORE

---

## 1. WORLDVIEW MODEL (IMMUTABLE)

Purpose:
Defines structural logic, interpretation hierarchy, constraint philosophy.

Rules:
- No ledger inserts directly into this section.
- No runtime mutation.
- Acts as constitutional layer.

---

## 2. DOCTRINE

Operational philosophy.
Environmental behavior standards.
Constraint-first alignment.

---

## 3. OPERATIONS

Execution logic.
Sequence handling.
Variance management.
Environment targeting.

---

## 4. SECURITY GATE (INTAKE LAYER)

All external input must pass through this layer.

Process:
1. Input received
2. Classified (environment / entity / behavior / ledger)
3. Validated against doctrine
4. Assigned insertion location

No direct injection allowed.

---

## 5. LEDGER REGISTRY

All ledgers must be recorded here before activation.

Fields:
- Ledger ID
- Source
- Environment
- Constraints
- FWF Profile
- Assigned Section
- Activation Status

---

## 6. SYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC

Evaluates:
- Environmental alignment
- Constraint sufficiency
- Missing reinforcement domains
- FWF stress points

Outputs:
- Suggested educational reinforcement
- Constraint strengthening
- Operational tuning
